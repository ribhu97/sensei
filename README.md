# sensei
A fintech interface built on the nOS platform.

Sensei is a open source interface dApp to allow external world conditions to trigger smart contracts on the NEO blockchain.

Sensei aims to create a simple way for external conditions like data from sensors or online triggers to be able to interact with smart contracts.

This interface would enable sensei to connect finance with real world trigger executions bridging a gap that exists in finanial services today.

This interface will be availble to use by anyone through the nOS dApp.

An indvidual would be able to register a trigger and set the conditions for the transaction.

# Example
1) Our first example will execute a contract triggered through a microcontroller with a fire detecting sensor atttached. The contract would execute when the fire is detected.
